Red-Team-vs.-Blue-Team-Project
I worked on a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which I played the role of both pentester and SOC analyst.
As the Red Team, I attacked a vulnerable VM within my environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. As Blue Team, I used Kibana to review logs taken during the Day 1 engagement. I used the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for my report.
Then, I interpreted my log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that I successfully performed.


In this project, I applied knowledge of the following skills and tools:


Penetration testing with Kali Linux.

Log and incident analysis with Kibana.

System hardening and configuration.

Reporting, documentation, and communication.

Lab Environment

In this unit, I used the Red vs Blue lab environment located in Windows Azure Lab Services. 
Opened the Hyper-V Manager to access the nested machines:
